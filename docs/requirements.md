## Technologies
**Alex Abraham**: I have a lot of experience in HTML and CSS and a good amount of experience in Javascript. I would like to learn more of React and implement it into our project and give it a better and more friendly user interface. I would like to create our project in Atom and host on Github pages. \
**Agapitus Iboro**: I have skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and php. While on the database side, I have skills in MySql, Oracle, SQL Server, SQL, and T-SQL.  And am open to learning new technology. \
**Sebastien Pierre-Louis**: I have a lot of experience with and relating to databases. I’m not sure of what I think of React. It seems interesting and daunting to try and create a full blown website, with new languages and platforms but up for the task. \
**May K**: I have experience with HTML and CSS. I also would like to learn more about React and learn more about user experience to make finding information about Data Analytics/Science major an easy experience.
